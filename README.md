### Covid-19 data sonification

At a time when visualisations of the latest data from the Covid-19 pandemic were a feature of everyday life, the idea behind this project was to use audio instead to communicate insights about the outbreak that might otherwise have been overlooked. 

It was an offshoot of a project I worked on at the BBC called ["How can we imagine the scale of Covid's death toll?"](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-7464500a-6368-4029-aa41-ab94e0ee09fb), but rather than a sound file to be heard over the internet the aim was to produce an orchestral score that could be experienced in person. 

The analytical approach and consequent musical output went through many iterations but the version now in this repo, produced in September 2021, divided up the data into those countries which had managed to secure vaccinations for a large proportion of their most vulnerable popluations, including Portugal, Singapore and the UK, and those which had not, for example Tanzania, Bangladesh and Mexico. 

The consequences of this uneven distribution can be heard in the resulting piece of music, which is produced from data on deaths linked to Covid-19 compiled by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and built using extracts from Schubert's magnificent "Death and the Maiden" string quartet.
